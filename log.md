# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 30, 2017

**Im now starting the 100days-of-code-challenge**:

To be honest I'was thinking about it for a longer time now, but never got to the point where I could overcome my inner laziness.
Well, I'm now  finally going to do it!

To get used to it, I will start with the Front-End-Certificate of FreeCodeCamp.
Later I'm planning to start programming React Native or rebuild my website with Jekyll.
But I will see!

As mentioned in my initial Twitter Post (@MTechert), logs will be created daily at the forked 100-days-of-code repository in my GitHub-Account, sometimes connected with a short twitter post.
For larger logs or additional comments on progress I'm making, I'm planning to write single Blog-entries on my website (manueltechert.com).

I'm glad and happy for all encouragement and feedback I receive!

### Day 1: November 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

Today I started with the Front-End-Certificate of the FreeCodeCamp where I relearned some basic HTML and CSS stuff. I
In addition I continued my CodeAcademy-Tutorial on React as prerequisite to code in React Native.

**Thoughts:**:

It's my first day to face the challenge.
I'm  pretty motivated to get through it and learn as much as I possibly can.

**Link to work:**:

As I'm working on the Front-End-Certificate in early stages, there is no link to show.
In a few days I will work on some first projects like writing some examples in HTML / CSS and JS.
I can't tell it yet but it will be something, I can give you a link to.

### Day 2: December 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

Today I continued making progress on the Front-End-Certificate at the FreeCodeCamp.
I managed to complete 32 exercises.
After that I tried out the Converse AI Dashboard of Google Actions, where I'm planning to create a little personal Jarvis for my home.

**Thoughts:**:

I haven't had any problems with the exercises I was faced with at FreeCodeCamp as I already know HTML, CSS and JS. Anyway, it was good to repeat that stuff and to take a look at details which I didn't know yet.

The Converse AI is pretty user-friendly. A little bit too much in my opinion but I managed to get used to the steps to take to create a conversation with different modules for my Google Home device. I will get back to it tomorrow.

When I'm far enough, to publish my little Jarvis at Google Actions you will be given a link to that.

### Day 3: December 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I made some more progress on the Front-End-Certificate. Currently I'm learning something about bootstrap.
I was thinking about my plans for the next few days. I definitely want to do something in React-Native, nothing too complicated. I already created a starter-project in my 100days-of-code-project repository. Actually I wanted to get more stuff done today, but unfortunately I'm feeling like I'm getting a bit ill.

**Thoughts:**:

The challenges about bootstrap weren't that hard to complete. It was just about adding some different classes to my HTML-elements and understanding what their impact is.
I'm struggling with the choose of a project to start with. So many things I want to try.

**Link to work:**:

You can check out the link to my FreeCodeCamp here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/manueltechert
My initial React-Native project is located at https://github.com/ManuelTechert/100days-of-code-projects
in the "example" folder. Yet is doesn't contain any written code.

### Day 4: December 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I have now completed 103 exercises on the Front-End-Certification.
I'm faced to do the first project on FreeCodeCamp, creating a tribute page with CodePen.io.
I will start with it tomorrow.

As a quick correction to yesterday: My repository for the 100days-of-code projects is now deleted.
I decided to separate single projects to their own repositories for a better overview and maintenance.

**Thoughts:**:

I really had fun working with jQuery today and had no problems with it.
I'm looking forward to start with the project tomorrow and try out CodePen.io.

As I now deleted my project folder for the 100-days-of-code, my initial React-Native-Code isn't published right now. Tomorrow you will finally get a link to my CodePen, which contains my work I'm doing on the project.

### Day 5: December 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

Today I started the first project on FreeCodeCamp, I succesfully built a tribute page about Desmond Doss. Some of you may know him from the movie "Hacksaw Ridge", which is about him. You can check it out below.

After that, I started the second challenge where I was asked to build a personal-portfolio-page. I made some quick progress on it and sadly got stuck, that's why I will continue working on it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**:

I had minor problems with positioning while building the tribute page. I wanted to integrate something with jQuery in the tribute page. That's why I got a button which fades the count of people, Desmond Doss saved, in.

Moving on to the second challenge, I got stuck at positioning my navbar with bootstrap. I did research on the Grid-system and googled about 1-2 hours with no success. Guess, I got a little problem to solve tomorrow.

Link to the second challenge will be given when I have finished it.
