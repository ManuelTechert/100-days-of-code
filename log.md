# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 30, 2017

**Im now starting the 100days-of-code-challenge**:

To be honest I'was thinking about it for a longer time now, but never got to the point where I could overcome my inner laziness.
Well, I'm now  finally going to do it!

To get used to it, I will start with the Front-End-Certificate of FreeCodeCamp.
Later I'm planning to start programming React Native or rebuild my website with Jekyll.
But I will see!

As mentioned in my initial Twitter Post (@MTechert), logs will be created daily at the forked 100-days-of-code repository in my GitHub-Account, sometimes connected with a short twitter post.
For larger logs or additional comments on progress I'm making, I'm planning to write single Blog-entries on my website (manueltechert.com).

I'm glad and happy for all encouragement and feedback I receive!

### Day 1: November 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

Today I started with the Front-End-Certificate of the FreeCodeCamp.
In addition I continued my CodeAcademy-Tutorial on React as prerequisite to code in React Native.

**Thoughts:**:

It's my first day to face the challenge.
I'm  pretty motivated to get through it and learn as much as I possibly can.

**Link to work:**:

As I'm working on the Front-End-Certificate in early stages, there is no link to show.
In a few days I will work on some first projects like writing some examples in HTML / CSS and JS.
I can't tell it yet but it will be something, I can give you a link to.
