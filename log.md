# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 30, 2017

**Im now starting the 100days-of-code-challenge**:

To be honest I'was thinking about it for a longer time now, but never got to the point where I could overcome my inner laziness.
Well, I'm now  finally going to do it!

To get used to it, I will start with the Front-End-Certificate of FreeCodeCamp.
Later I'm planning to start programming React Native or rebuild my website with Jekyll.
But I will see!

As mentioned in my initial Twitter Post (@MTechert), logs will be created daily at the forked 100-days-of-code repository in my GitHub-Account, sometimes connected with a short twitter post.
For larger logs or additional comments on progress I'm making, I'm planning to write single Blog-entries on my website (manueltechert.com).

I'm glad and happy for all encouragement and feedback I receive!

### Day 1: November 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

Today I started with the Front-End-Certificate of the FreeCodeCamp where I relearned some basic HTML and CSS stuff. I
In addition I continued my CodeAcademy-Tutorial on React as prerequisite to code in React Native.

**Thoughts:**:

It's my first day to face the challenge.
I'm  pretty motivated to get through it and learn as much as I possibly can.

**Link to work:**:

As I'm working on the Front-End-Certificate in early stages, there is no link to show.
In a few days I will work on some first projects like writing some examples in HTML / CSS and JS.
I can't tell it yet but it will be something, I can give you a link to.

### Day 2: December 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

Today I continued making progress on the Front-End-Certificate at the FreeCodeCamp.
I managed to complete 32 exercises.
After that I tried out the Converse AI Dashboard of Google Actions, where I'm planning to create a little personal Jarvis for my home.

**Thoughts:**:

I haven't had any problems with the exercises I was faced with at FreeCodeCamp as I already know HTML, CSS and JS. Anyway, it was good to repeat that stuff and to take a look at details which I didn't know yet.

The Converse AI is pretty user-friendly. A little bit too much in my opinion but I managed to get used to the steps to take to create a conversation with different modules for my Google Home device. I will get back to it tomorrow.

**Link to work:**:

When I'm far enough, to publish my little Jarvis at Google Actions you will be given a link to that.

### Day 3: December 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I made some more progress on the Front-End-Certificate. Currently I'm learning something about bootstrap.
I was thinking about my plans for the next few days. I definitely want to do something in React-Native, nothing too complicated. I already created a starter-project in my 100days-of-code-project repository. Actually I wanted to get more stuff done today, but unfortunately I'm feeling like I'm getting a bit ill.

**Thoughts:**:

The challenges about bootstrap weren't that hard to complete. It was just about adding some different classes to my HTML-elements and understanding what their impact is.
I'm struggling with the choose of a project to start with. So many things I want to try.

**Link to work:**:

You can check out the link to my FreeCodeCamp here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/manueltechert
My initial React-Native project is located at https://github.com/ManuelTechert/100days-of-code-projects
in the "example" folder. Yet is doesn't contain any written code.

### Day 4: December 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I have now completed 103 exercises on the Front-End-Certification.
I'm faced to do the first project on FreeCodeCamp, creating a tribute page with CodePen.io.
I will start with it tomorrow.

As a quick correction to yesterday: My repository for the 100days-of-code projects is now deleted.
I decided to separate single projects to their own repositories for a better overview and maintenance.

**Thoughts:**:

I really had fun working with jQuery today and had no problems with it.
I'm looking forward to start with the project tomorrow and try out CodePen.io.

As I now deleted my project folder for the 100-days-of-code, my initial React-Native-Code isn't published right now. Tomorrow you will finally get a link to my CodePen, which contains my work I'm doing on the project.

### Day 5: December 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

Today I started the first project on FreeCodeCamp, I succesfully built a tribute page about Desmond Doss. Some of you may know him from the movie "Hacksaw Ridge", which is about him. You can check it out below.

After that, I started the second challenge where I was asked to build a personal-portfolio-page. I made some quick progress on it and sadly got stuck, that's why I will continue working on it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**:

I had minor problems with positioning while building the tribute page. I wanted to integrate something with jQuery in the tribute page. That's why I got a button which fades the count of people, Desmond Doss saved, in.

Moving on to the second challenge, I got stuck at positioning my navbar with bootstrap. I did research on the Grid-system and googled about 1-2 hours with no success. Guess, I got a little problem to solve tomorrow.

**Link to work:**:

You can check out the link to my FreeCodeCamp here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/manueltechert

My CodePen for the first challenge: https://codepen.io/ghosti97/pen/QOYVPB

Link to the second challenge will be given when I have finished it.

### Day 6: December 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

Today I continued working on the 2nd project of the Front-End-Certification. I solved the problem from yesterday.
I now got correct positioning of my navbar. I added social icons, colors, a form and a css class for the active link.

**Thoughts:**:

The work on the second project was pretty hard for me. I spend several hours on creating a simple-looking-website. I had problems with bootstrap which are mostly solved now. My navbar, however, didn't want to work as I put the single links as li-elements in my ul.
I got a workaround with some p elements, but I definitely want to correct that tomorrow. In addition, when I added "position:fixed" to my nav, the size of the bar doesn't fit in my container yet.
Last topic on this project will be the JS-part with adding code to show, which link is selected.

### Day 7: December 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

On this wednesday I have finished the second project I was working on (Yey, I made it!). 
After that, I continued with some Javascript-exercises on freecodecamp.
I managed to do around 100 exercises.
I bought an Udemy-course yesterday about React and React-Native and started with it.

**Thoughts:**:

Yesterday I was struggling with some minor problems at building the portfolio page. 
Starting today I solved every problem that occured, placed my navbar in the foreground with a higher z-index and recolored my content.
I added some sample pictures for the portfolio and a profile photo.
I'm pretty motivated right now because I'm making some nice progress and got some projects I built, feels great!

### Day 8: December 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I completed the basic Javascript exercises on FreeCodeCamp and moved on to basic algorithm scripting whose completion is set to about 50 hours. I already solved around the half of it today.
In addition I worked a bit more on the recently bought React-Native course on udemy and played around with Javascript.

**Thoughts:**:

Was a gretty good day today, but I'm definitely having more fun building own projects as the last few days. 
Anyway, learning Javascript is pretty important and the algorithm scripting is a good opportunity to dive into the thinking of a programmer.
I'm already hyped to complete all exercises necessary to move on to the intermediate front-end projects!
Maybe I will build a little game the next week with some HTML, CSS and JS.

### Day 9: December 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

Today I've completed the basic algorithm scripting.
I moved on to JSON APIs and Ajax and completed this short section.
That means, now the intermediate projects will start!

**Thoughts:**:

The algorithms were pretty hard for some exercises and I spend several hours on it.
I'm now looking forward to start with the projects the next week, as I will pause the weekend to relax a bit.
These paused days will not be logged! So the next day a log will be created for is monday the 11th with day 10.

**Link to work:**:

You can check out the link to my FreeCodeCamp here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/manueltechert

### Day 10: December 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I started the first intermediate project, a Random Quote Machine!
I could already finish it within several hours.

**Thoughts:**:

Forming the basic shape of the Random Quote Machine page was pretty easy. It became a bit tricky using an API to get random quotes. I googled for a suitable API to use and quickly found one.
It was hard for me to adjust the href-attribute of my Twitter-link to have it's url containing the quote shown at the moment.
At first my link was set to the content of the last quote requested by the user. With a Javascript-Promise, I managed to fix this.
The page is now finished and should function properly.

### Day 11: December 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I started and completed the second project, a Local Weather App.
Spent around five hours on creating it.

**Thoughts:**:

I'm learning more and more every day. A few weeks ago, I wouldn't have thought I could  build a Local Weather App.
It felt great and I hadn't any major problems with it.
I'm planning to deploy the last two projects on Heroku to get to know the process of deploying an app.

**Link to work:**:

You can check out the link to my FreeCodeCamp here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/manueltechert

Link to my Local Weather App: https://codepen.io/ghosti97/pen/XVWXeb 

Keep in mind to open the link with the https to get the geolocation to work.
I read the geolocation I used will be deprecated this December 2017, but I still used it. Just for the notes.

### Day 12: December 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I started and completed the third project, a Wikipedia Viewer (Three projects in three days, yeah!).
You can either watch a random article or search entries through a search bar.
Took me about four or five hours to create it.

**Thoughts:**:

Getting data from the Wikipedia-API wasn't as easy as it was for the Local Weather App.
I was faced with a Cross-origin-resource-sharing (CORS) problem while trying to get the data with a usual ajax call (JSON-format).
To bypass the same-origin-policy I solved this problem using JSONP.

**Link to work:**:

I won't link my FreeCodeCamp anymore as you can look it up in earlier log entries.
Only real project or work links are now being listed in this area.

Link to my Wikipedia-Viewer: https://codepen.io/ghosti97/full/GyggdO/ (Full-page-link)

Note: Right now, you will need to click 'open link in new tab' for available results after hitting the search-button. 

### Day 13: December 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

Today I started working on the fourth and last project of the intermediate ones.
I finished the Twitch.tv-Viewer in around four hours.

**Thoughts:**:

This last project was the most difficult since I have started. I had problems setting data for my eight stream-entries in a foreach or for-loop, because JS is asynchronous. I tried it with Promises and failed.

I then solved it using a nested function in my for-loop and a timeout, so each value is set for the right entry.
Also, I needed to use two JSON-calls, one for the stream data and one to check if the stream is online right now.
The sorting buttons weren't a problem.

In the end, the page is working and that means I'm done with the intermediate projects!

Will move on to the algorithm scripting tomorrow.

**Link to work:**:

Link to my Twitch.tv-Viewer: https://codepen.io/ghosti97/full/JMoqzM/ (Full-page-link)

Note: You will need to click 'open link in new tab' for the stream links. 

### Day 14: December 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I started with intermediate algorithm scripting challenges and finished a few of them.

**Thoughts:**:

Well as I've written before, I like building projects more than algorithm scripting.
Still, it's important to do.
Wasn't that hard for me today, but I will pause over the weekend to regain focus.

**Link to work:**:

No link today!

### Day 15: December 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I continued with the intermediate algorithm scripting. Got a few left to solve.

**Thoughts:**:

Finished a lot of the algorithms, so I'm definitely making progress. 

Still, I'm feeling a bit tired today which causes a loss of focus.

**Link to work:**:

No link today.

### Day 16: December 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I finished the section "intermediate algorithm scripting" today and moved on to advanced algorithms.

**Thoughts:**:

Good progress so far, algorithms are a bit more "boring" as building projects.
I hope I will get through them in a few days so I can start with the last projects of the Front-End-Certification.
After the Certification, I guess there will be more room for projects of my own.

**Link to work:**:

No link today.

### Day 17: December 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I finished the advanced algorithms, which now takes me to the last projects.
I started with the first one, a javascript-calculator.
I built the basics of it and styled it, but real functionality will be implemented tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**:

Some algorithms were hard to solve. When I got stuck I looked for hints and solutions of other users, which helped me to understand what I was doing wrong. I'm hyped again to build new projects.

**Link to work:**:

I will give you a link to the finished calculator probably tomorrow or within the next few days.

### Day 18: December 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I finished the calculator as the first project. All user-stories are in my pen, so I marked this project as completed.
I'm still not done with this project - error handling and wrong user inputs need to be needed when I've got time.

**Thoughts:**:

I really love building projects. The feeling seeing your project come to life and working out at some point, is just incredibly satisfying.

**Link to work:**:

The link to my calculator: https://codepen.io/ghosti97/pen/eyzOOM

### Day 19: December 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I started with the second project, a pomodor clock. Basic shaping is fine, functionality is not yet implemented.
I fixed some issues on my calculator.

**Thoughts:**:

Having fun like almost every day, but couldn't take that much input in it today, because christmas is coming. 

**Link to work:**:

Link for pomodoro clock will be given in some of the next logs.

### Day 20: January 08, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

I finished the pomodoro clock today, but one missing functionality will be added tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**:

Had a longer pause because of christmas and a disease afterwards. Didn't take long to get back in programming. 

Pomodoro Clock is working. One thing to fix tomorrow is, that the Clock won't start a new round, once the main timer and break timer are both run out.

**Link to work:**:

Link for pomodoro clock: https://codepen.io/ghosti97/full/mprLZo/ (full-page-link).

### Day 21: January 09, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

I started with the Tic Tac Toe game today. 

**Thoughts:**:

Creating the game was hard at the very beginning having no clue where exactly to start.
It then got better and I made good progress. 

To finish the game, I need to solve a problem which is about swapping turns between the computer and the player. I tried it with a loop or putting the computers turn in the players one, but nothing worked.

**Link to work:**:

Link for Tic Tac Toe game will be given once it's finished.

### Day 22: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

I finished the Tic Tac Toe game today. Maybe I will implement a better algorithm later in this challenge, but for now the computer is playing randomly.

**Thoughts:**:

Fixed the problems of yesterday. The turns are now calling each other. So the computer will call the method playerRound(), once its finished. Before every turn is executed, the game checks for a gameover.
One more project for the FrontEndCertification!

**Link to work:**:

### Day 23: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

I made some good progress on the Simon game. The computers side is working properly, the players inputs are not recognized correctly yet.

**Thoughts:**:

I struggled hard today. Felt like I couldn't concentrate that well. I put in several hours of work in the Simon game, but I will still need some more time, since some problems occured. Main reasons were the timing of the button presses and the correct recognition of user inputs.

**Link to work:**:

Link for the Simon game will be given in some of the next logs.

### Day 24: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

I spend like 4/5 hours on the Simon game bug, still doesn't work.

**Thoughts:**:

I didn't think this project would take that much time. The problem is, that my onclick function of a field should add exactly one value to the players move array. For some reason it adds to many of them, which leads to a non working user input recognition. I tried everything, asked some friends for help, but didn't really help me with my solution. I discovered changing my player move array to "var" would fix the problem for the first round but then it gets complicated to have the array visible in all relevant functions.
The click function is properly called exactly once, a manual add without the push function for the array isn't working either.
I will, either rewrite the whole game in a new concept or fix the problem next week.

**Link to work:**:

Link for the Simon game will be given in some of the next logs.

### Day 25: January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

I finally finished the Simon game and got my Front-End-Certification!

**Thoughts:**:

I solved the problem of last week with onclick events for each color field. Each field now has a separate function.
I then implemented the strict mode, worked on the reset and redesigned the whole game a bit.
I'm now thinking about the plan for the next weeks.

Link for the Simon game: https://codepen.io/ghosti97/full/XVBBBe/

### Day 26: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

I decided to learn Swift in the next weeks. Started today with basic syntax.
As I'm moving on, I will evntually post links to little projects im creating.

**Thoughts:**:

I couldn't even decide, what to learn next. There are so many topics I'm interested in. I think Swift is a good step towards app development, creating games with sprite kit or using the AR kit.

**Link to work:**:

No link today.

### Day 27: January 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

I continued learning Swift with my Udemy course. Learned about Node.js and Express.

**Thoughts:**:

There are so many ressources I have for Swift right now. The course is fine, it's even too much information on basic functions and syntax as I'm not new to programming. I got a separate course for the Sprite Kit which I will start soon.
It's important to practice with projects so I will think about some little starter projects.

**Link to work:**:

No link today.

### Day 28: January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

Some Swift, not that much more today.

**Thoughts:**:

Swift syntax is cool but it's a bit confusing at some places.
For example I have to get used to the loop syntax like "for i in 1...10 ".

**Link to work:**:

No link today.

### Day 29: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

Swift practice in Xcode, also looked at SpriteKit. In some weeks I want to develop a little game or learn a bit about the AR kit.

**Thoughts:**:

In some weeks I want to develop a little game or learn a bit about the AR kit. I'a not as productive right now as I was at freecodecamps challenges. Thats because I do not have a specific goal at Swift. So I need to set one next week.

**Link to work:**:

No link today.

### Day 30: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

Swift practice, set a goal - I will build an Ethereum Viewer in Swift. XCode inital project setup.

**Thoughts:**:

Well, problem was I did not have a specific goal - Now I've got one. I will build an Ethereum Viewer which will be able to show current and past values in basic numbers and diagrams. I need to learn so much, but I'm of the opinion you really need to do a thing, to stick it in your head. That's why I will begin with a project to really learn Swift.

**Link to work:**:

All code will now be pushed to the initial repository: https://github.com/ManuelTechert/ethereum-viewer

### Day 31: January 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

I got an advice for my project setup at GitHub - so I rebuilt my repo at the same link letting out the Tests at the Xcode project setup and adding a gitignore I can modify. I then learned basic UI in Swift, created two little Screens for first steps in Figma and recreated them in the Xcode main storyboard. So I really started with the project today.

**Thoughts:**:

By now I have good sources to follow for the project. Building a basic UI is pretty fun so far, tomorrow I'll be learning about connecting UI to the code. In addition I have to think about which values to show in my app and which API to use.
I guess I will do most of this work in Figma and will rebuild it in Xcode.

**Link to work:**:

My screens in Figma (more is coming!): https://www.figma.com/file/XpLn1oxQKDYiQjPSO5e5LtmO/Ethereum-Viewer
The repo link for the Ethereum Viewer is still the same.

### Day 32: January 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

So I continued with my design on Figma today and recreated it at Xcode. Added a navbar and my own icons from Figma. Exported my images as SVG from Figma to Adobe XD, then exported it there as PNG to use in Xcode. Also added an Ethereum icon and a new storyboard for the upcoming diagram screen.

**Thoughts:**:

Actually wanted to connect code to the UI today, but first I have to continue working on the UI. Struggled shortly with exporting the Figma SVGs to Xcode and how to use the Image viewer.

**Link to work:**:

My screens in Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/XpLn1oxQKDYiQjPSO5e5LtmO/Ethereum-Viewer

### Day 33: January 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

I continued with recreating the Figma design in Xcode. I connected the currents both labels as Outlets and my "To EUR" button as Action to the ViewController. I wrote code to make a click on the button change between two values in the currents value.

**Thoughts:**:

Well, I now know how to build a basic UI and how to connect the code to the UI. 
Things are getting serious. I need an API now. 

I thought about my News area at the bottom of the first screen and came to the conclusion to use a RSS feed or a reddit thread with an "Ethereum" category. In addition I need a library where I can use diagrams from.

**Link to work:**:

All code is being pushed to the repository: https://github.com/ManuelTechert/ethereum-viewer
