# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 30, 2017

**Im now starting the 100days-of-code-challenge**:

To be honest I'was thinking about it for a longer time now, but never got to the point where I could overcome my inner laziness.
Well, I'm now  finally going to do it!

To get used to it, I will start with the Front-End-Certificate of FreeCodeCamp.
Later I'm planning to start programming React Native or rebuild my website with Jekyll.
But I will see!

As mentioned in my initial Twitter Post (@MTechert), logs will be created daily at the forked 100-days-of-code repository in my GitHub-Account, sometimes connected with a short twitter post.
For larger logs or additional comments on progress I'm making, I'm planning to write single Blog-entries on my website (manueltechert.com).

I'm glad and happy for all encouragement and feedback I receive!

### Day 1: November 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

Today I started with the Front-End-Certificate of the FreeCodeCamp where I relearned some basic HTML and CSS stuff. I
In addition I continued my CodeAcademy-Tutorial on React as prerequisite to code in React Native.

**Thoughts:**:

It's my first day to face the challenge.
I'm  pretty motivated to get through it and learn as much as I possibly can.

**Link to work:**:

As I'm working on the Front-End-Certificate in early stages, there is no link to show.
In a few days I will work on some first projects like writing some examples in HTML / CSS and JS.
I can't tell it yet but it will be something, I can give you a link to.

### Day 2: December 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

Today I continued making progress on the Front-End-Certificate at the FreeCodeCamp.
I managed to complete 32 exercises.
After that I tried out the Converse AI Dashboard of Google Actions, where I'm planning to create a little personal Jarvis for my home.

**Thoughts:**:

I haven't had any problems with the exercices I was faced with at FreeCodeCamp as I already know HTML, CSS and JS. Anyway, it was good to repeat that stuff and to take a look at details which I didn't know yet.

The Converse AI is pretty user-friendly. A little bit too much in my opinion but I managed to get used to the steps to take to create a conversation with different modules for my Google Home device. I will get back to it tomorrow.
**Link to work:**:

When I'm far enough, to publish my little Jarvis at Google Actions you will be given a link to that.
