# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 30, 2017

**Im now starting the 100days-of-code-challenge**:

To be honest I'was thinking about it for a longer time now, but never got to the point where I could overcome my inner laziness.
Well, I'm now  finally going to do it!

To get used to it, I will start with the Front-End-Certificate of FreeCodeCamp.
Later I'm planning to start programming React Native or rebuild my website with Jekyll.
But I will see!

As mentioned in my initial Twitter Post (@MTechert), logs will be created daily at the forked 100-days-of-code repository in my GitHub-Account, sometimes connected with a short twitter post.
For larger logs or additional comments on progress I'm making, I'm planning to write single Blog-entries on my website (manueltechert.com).

I'm glad and happy for all encouragement and feedback I receive!

### Day 1: November 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

Today I started with the Front-End-Certificate of the FreeCodeCamp where I relearned some basic HTML and CSS stuff. I
In addition I continued my CodeAcademy-Tutorial on React as prerequisite to code in React Native.

**Thoughts:**:

It's my first day to face the challenge.
I'm  pretty motivated to get through it and learn as much as I possibly can.

**Link to work:**:

As I'm working on the Front-End-Certificate in early stages, there is no link to show.
In a few days I will work on some first projects like writing some examples in HTML / CSS and JS.
I can't tell it yet but it will be something, I can give you a link to.

### Day 2: December 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

Today I continued making progress on the Front-End-Certificate at the FreeCodeCamp.
I managed to complete 32 exercises.
After that I tried out the Converse AI Dashboard of Google Actions, where I'm planning to create a little personal Jarvis for my home.

**Thoughts:**:

I haven't had any problems with the exercises I was faced with at FreeCodeCamp as I already know HTML, CSS and JS. Anyway, it was good to repeat that stuff and to take a look at details which I didn't know yet.

The Converse AI is pretty user-friendly. A little bit too much in my opinion but I managed to get used to the steps to take to create a conversation with different modules for my Google Home device. I will get back to it tomorrow.

When I'm far enough, to publish my little Jarvis at Google Actions you will be given a link to that.

### Day 3: December 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I made some more progress on the Front-End-Certificate. Currently I'm learning something about bootstrap.
I was thinking about my plans for the next few days. I definitely want to do something in React-Native, nothing too complicated. I already created a starter-project in my 100days-of-code-project repository. Actually I wanted to get more stuff done today, but unfortunately I'm feeling like I'm getting a bit ill.

**Thoughts:**:

The challenges about bootstrap weren't that hard to complete. It was just about adding some different classes to my HTML-elements and understanding what their impact is.
I'm struggling with the choose of a project to start with. So many things I want to try.

**Link to work:**:

You can check out the link to my FreeCodeCamp here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/manueltechert
My initial React-Native project is located at https://github.com/ManuelTechert/100days-of-code-projects
in the "example" folder. Yet is doesn't contain any written code.

### Day 4: December 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I have now completed 103 exercises on the Front-End-Certification.
I'm faced to do the first project on FreeCodeCamp, creating a tribute page with CodePen.io.
I will start with it tomorrow.

As a quick correction to yesterday: My repository for the 100days-of-code projects is now deleted.
I decided to separate single projects to their own repositories for a better overview and maintenance.

**Thoughts:**:

I really had fun working with jQuery today and had no problems with it.
I'm looking forward to start with the project tomorrow and try out CodePen.io.

As I now deleted my project folder for the 100-days-of-code, my initial React-Native-Code isn't published right now. Tomorrow you will finally get a link to my CodePen, which contains my work I'm doing on the project.

### Day 5: December 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

Today I started the first project on FreeCodeCamp, I succesfully built a tribute page about Desmond Doss. Some of you may know him from the movie "Hacksaw Ridge", which is about him. You can check it out below.

After that, I started the second challenge where I was asked to build a personal-portfolio-page. I made some quick progress on it and sadly got stuck, that's why I will continue working on it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**:

I had minor problems with positioning while building the tribute page. I wanted to integrate something with jQuery in the tribute page. That's why I got a button which fades the count of people, Desmond Doss saved, in.

Moving on to the second challenge, I got stuck at positioning my navbar with bootstrap. I did research on the Grid-system and googled about 1-2 hours with no success. Guess, I got a little problem to solve tomorrow.

My CodePen for the first challenge: https://codepen.io/ghosti97/pen/QOYVPB

Link to the second challenge will be given when I have finished it.

### Day 6: December 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

Today I continued working on the 2nd project of the Front-End-Certification. I solved the problem from yesterday.
I now got correct positioning of my navbar. I added social icons, colors, a form and a css class for the active link.

**Thoughts:**:

The work on the second project was pretty hard for me. I spend several hours on creating a simple-looking-website. I had problems with bootstrap which are mostly solved now. My navbar, however, didn't want to work as I put the single links as li-elements in my ul.
I got a workaround with some p elements, but I definitely want to correct that tomorrow. In addition, when I added "position:fixed" to my nav, the size of the bar doesn't fit in my container yet.
Last topic on this project will be the JS-part with adding code to show, which link is selected.

### Day 7: December 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

On this wednesday I have finished the second project I was working on (Yey, I made it!). 
After that, I continued with some Javascript-exercises on freecodecamp.
I managed to do around 100 exercises.
I bought an Udemy-course yesterday about React and React-Native and started with it.

**Thoughts:**:

Yesterday I was struggling with some minor problems at building the portfolio page. 
Starting today I solved every problem that occured, placed my navbar in the foreground with a higher z-index and recolored my content.
I added some sample pictures for the portfolio and a profile photo.
I'm pretty motivated right now because I'm making some nice progress and got some projects I built, feels great!

### Day 8: December 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I completed the basic Javascript exercises on FreeCodeCamp and moved on to basic algorithm scripting whose completion is set to about 50 hours. I already solved around the half of it today.
In addition I worked a bit more on the recently bought React-Native course on udemy and played around with Javascript.

**Thoughts:**:

Was a gretty good day today, but I'm definitely having more fun building own projects as the last few days. 
Anyway, learning Javascript is pretty important and the algorithm scripting is a good opportunity to dive into the thinking of a programmer.
I'm already hyped to complete all exercises necessary to move on to the intermediate front-end projects!
Maybe I will build a little game the next week with some HTML, CSS and JS.

### Day 9: December 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

Today I've completed the basic algorithm scripting.
I moved on to JSON APIs and Ajax and completed this short section.
That means, now the intermediate projects will start!

**Thoughts:**:

The algorithms were pretty hard for some exercises and I spend several hours on it.
I'm now looking forward to start with the projects the next week, as I will pause the weekend to relax a bit.
These paused days will not be logged! So the next day a log will be created for is monday the 11th with day 10.

### Day 10: December 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I started the first intermediate project, a Random Quote Machine!
I could already finish it within several hours.

**Thoughts:**:

Forming the basic shape of the Random Quote Machine page was pretty easy. It became a bit tricky using an API to get random quotes. I googled for a suitable API to use and quickly found one.
It was hard for me to adjust the href-attribute of my Twitter-link to have it's url containing the quote shown at the moment.
At first my link was set to the content of the last quote requested by the user. With a Javascript-Promise, I managed to fix this.
The page is now finished and should function properly.

### Day 11: December 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I started and completed the second project, a Local Weather App.
Spent around five hours on creating it.

**Thoughts:**:

I'm learning more and more every day. A few weeks ago, I wouldn't have thought I could  build a Local Weather App.
It felt great and I hadn't any major problems with it.
I'm planning to deploy the last two projects on Heroku to get to know the process of deploying an app.

Link to my Local Weather App: https://codepen.io/ghosti97/pen/XVWXeb 

Keep in mind to open the link with the https to get the geolocation to work.
I read the geolocation I used will be deprecated this December 2017, but I still used it. Just for the notes.

### Day 12: December 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I started and completed the third project, a Wikipedia Viewer (Three projects in three days, yeah!).
You can either watch a random article or search entries through a search bar.
Took me about four or five hours to create it.

**Thoughts:**:

Getting data from the Wikipedia-API wasn't as easy as it was for the Local Weather App.
I was faced with a Cross-origin-resource-sharing (CORS) problem while trying to get the data with a usual ajax call (JSON-format).
To bypass the same-origin-policy I solved this problem using JSONP.

**Link to work:**:

I won't link my FreeCodeCamp anymore as you can look it up in earlier log entries.
Only real project or work links are now being listed in this area.

Link to my Wikipedia-Viewer: https://codepen.io/ghosti97/full/GyggdO/ (Full-page-link)

Note: Right now, you will need to click 'open link in new tab' for available results after hitting the search-button. 

### Day 13: December 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

Today I started working on the fourth and last project of the intermediate ones.
I finished the Twitch.tv-Viewer in around four hours.

**Thoughts:**:

This last project was the most difficult since I have started. I had problems setting data for my eight stream-entries in a foreach or for-loop, because JS is asynchronous. I tried it with Promises and failed.

I then solved it using a nested function in my for-loop and a timeout, so each value is set for the right entry.
Also, I needed to use two JSON-calls, one for the stream data and one to check if the stream is online right now.
The sorting buttons weren't a problem.

In the end, the page is working and that means I'm done with the intermediate projects!

Will move on to the algorithm scripting tomorrow.

**Link to work:**:

Note: You will need to click 'open link in new tab' for the stream links. 

### Day 14: December 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I started with intermediate algorithm scripting challenges and finished a few of them.

**Thoughts:**:

Well as I've written before, I like building projects more than algorithm scripting.
Still, it's important to do.
Wasn't that hard for me today, but I will pause over the weekend to regain focus.

**Link to work:**:

No link today!

### Day 15: December 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I continued with the intermediate algorithm scripting. Got a few left to solve.

**Thoughts:**:

Finished a lot of the algorithms, so I'm definitely making progress. 

Still, I'm feeling a bit tired today which causes a loss of focus.

**Link to work:**:

No link today.

### Day 16: December 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I finished the section "intermediate algorithm scripting" today and moved on to advanced algorithms.

**Thoughts:**:

Good progress so far, algorithms are a bit more "boring" as building projects.
I hope I will get through them in a few days so I can start with the last projects of the Front-End-Certification.
After the Certification, I guess there will be more room for projects of my own.

**Link to work:**:

No link today.

### Day 17: December 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I finished the advanced algorithms, which now takes me to the last projects.
I started with the first one, a javascript-calculator.
I built the basics of it and styled it, but real functionality will be implemented tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**:

Some algorithms were hard to solve. When I got stuck I looked for hints and solutions of other users, which helped me to understand what I was doing wrong. I'm hyped again to build new projects.

**Link to work:**:

I will give you a link to the finished calculator probably tomorrow or within the next few days.

### Day 18: December 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I finished the calculator as the first project. All user-stories are in my pen, so I marked this project as completed.
I'm still not done with this project - error handling and wrong user inputs need to be needed when I've got time.

**Thoughts:**:

I really love building projects. The feeling seeing your project come to life and working out at some point, is just incredibly satisfying.

**Link to work:**:

The link to my calculator: https://codepen.io/ghosti97/pen/eyzOOM

### Day 19: December 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**:

I started with the second project, a pomodor clock. Basic shaping is fine, functionality is not yet implemented.
I fixed some issues on my calculator.

**Thoughts:**:

Having fun like almost every day, but couldn't take that much input in it today, because christmas is coming. 

**Link to work:**:

Link for pomodoro clock will be given in some of the next logs.
